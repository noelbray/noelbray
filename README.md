- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Noel.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in doing remote coding work becase I like to code.

- üå± 
* I've been teaching myself HTML, CSS and Javascript, Frontend web development for a while now by reading and doing free tutorials on Codecademy, Free Code Camp, W3xhools and other websites.
* I read "The Beginner's Guide to SEO" by MOZ.com.
* I began teaching myself some backend web development, most of which I've been doing, learning on Free Code Camp, but temporarily stoped because there were issues with there "testing" algorithms which were causing some test to fail for varying reasons even if the code, answer was correct - within the guidelines, parameters of the test. But they may have fixed the bugs, issues by now, so I may return to it eventually. 
* While waiting on Free Code Camp to finish the updates, I worked on some things, code, app for my website that I hope to eventually put on my website. 
* I‚Äôm currently teaching myself git by reading the "Pro Git Book" that is available online for free; I created a repository called clone-repository-with-git to takes notes and practice commands and things as I was reading the "Pro Git Book." After finishing reading the book, I decided to reread the first couple of chapters again to try to reinforce and practice what I've been learning in it such as git add <file-name>, git log, and other important commands to enable me to do remote frontend web development work or some other related work to it through Github.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on a project or something with people who enjoy coding; who don't mind answering each others questions with regards to code, project, etc.; who don't mind helping each other so that the project, task, app or etc. is coded and done well. I wouldn't mind being hired to do HTML, CSS, or JS or something else you think I'm capable of. If you want to hire me to do just HTML or just CSS or a little bit of JS to see what I can do or to help me git my foot in the door and gradually work my way up to more complicated things, I'm okay with that too.

- Checkout some of the things I've done:
* [My Web Develper Portofo](https://www.noelbray.com/web-developer/web-developer-portfolio.html)
* [My Personal Website I built from scratch](https://www.noelbray.com)
* [Free Code Camp Web Developer Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/nwbray-code)
* [Codepen Profile](https://codepen.io/nwbnwb)
* [The BBQ Shack Fanning Springs](https://www.thebbqshackfanningsprings.com/)
  * I did my best to write semantically correct local search engine optimized html code and content for it. They aren't a large business and didn't have any fancy images produced by photographers. So I used an image, made by, I think, a relative or daughter in-law, that was one of their old facebook images to use for the website. I didn't have photshop, so I downloaded Krita (free drawing software) and quickly learned just what I needed to modify the image I pulled from the restaurant's facebook page to make the background image as well as the clickable "Shack" image at the top-right corner of the website for the mobile version of the main navigation, menu. I did the best I could with what I had. It's not not a super fancy website, but I think it's a pretty good one. 
  * This was the 1st website I built for a business.
* [The 4 Workout a.k.a 4 | Free Online Full Body Workout Plan](https://www.noelbray.com/health-and-fitness-workouts/the-4-workout.html)
  * Since I like to exercise, I wrote this fitness ebook and made it available for free to help people getting started exercising, get back into exercising, complete their 1st fitnes goal, to do as an extra workout, and etc. to help them improve their health and fitness. (Sorry if this seems like an advertisment, I'm not trying to, I wanted to tell you about 4 so that you can see some of my coding work.)
  * It's a webpage app.

- I have a feeling I've taking longer to learn code than others, especially when I hear of people learning code in 6 months, but I study and study, reread and reread, stop to work on my website, stop to work on other things, stop to learn other things such as SEO, and stop for other reasons, but when I'm not doing those things, a large part of my day, at least several hours, every day except Sunday, I study, read, practice, watch or do something related to code. I wish I could remember everything I want or try to learn beacuse I want to be good at coding. I want to be great at coding. It would be awesome to become a super coder such that coding becomes second nature for me and algorithms, HTML, CSS, JS code just flows from my mind through my finger tips into the computer. 

- If you have any suggestions on how I can become better at coding and such, or if you have any suggestions on what you think would be good remote work for me to do, or if you have any suggestions on what I should learn based on what You think I may be good at, I'm open to hearing it. 

- Shoot, I don't get offended about things, so I'm open to talking about anything as long as you are not trying to get me to do something illegal or wrong in any way.

P.S. If you need prayer or know of someone who needs prayer, feel free to send me a message asking me to pray for you, someone else, or regarding anything else anytime. You can give a detailed or non-detailed, specific or general, prayer request; when I see and read it, I will pray.

Thank you for reading a little about me.

I hope you have a very great day,



Noel :slightly_smiling_face:
